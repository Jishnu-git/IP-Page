            Dimensionality Reduction using PCA: <br>
            There are several factors that might affect the performance of a Image classification model's performance. Our goal was to identify these factors and try to use
            Image processing techniques to improve the the perfomance. One of the most significant factor for any type of model is the size and volume of the input data.
            To achieve the goal of our project I decided to take up a simple CNN model available online and perform operations on the input image to reduce the data size and 
            measure the impact on the model. To begin with I looked into several image preprocessing techniques that were currently being used. The most common operation being 
            Principal Component Analysis.   
            For testing I have taken the CIFAR-10 dataset available in keras dataset and trained using a CNN model available online.

            Calculation of PSF for Motion Deblurring: <br>
            The point spread function is based on an infinitely small point source of light originating in the specimen (object) space. Because the microscope imaging system collects only a fraction of the light emitted by this point, 
            it cannot focus the light into a perfect three-dimensional image of the point. Instead, the point appears widened and spread into a three-dimensional diffraction pattern. Thus, the point spread function is formally defined 
            as the three-dimensional diffraction pattern generated by an ideal point source of light. <br>
            For motion deblurring we assume that the ideal image is transformed using the PSF to get the real image, where the parameters of the PSF is the length and the angle of motion. 
            Thus by using deconvulation on the real image to revert the effect of the PSF we can achieve the ideal image.

        <h2 class="text-center py-4 bg-green">Principal Component Analysis</h2>
        <p class="py-4">
            Principal Component Analysis is a dimension reduction method that transforms a large set of variables into smaller ones. It trades little accuracy for simplicity.
            It computes the Eigen Vectors and Eigen Values of the covariance matrix of the given data to identify the Principal component. Principal Component is a linear combination of the initial variables.
            Eigen vector is a vector that captures the variance of the data. By capturing the most amount of variance the single eigen vector will be able to store more amount of data. 
            After generating all possible eigen vectors and their respective eigen values we then create a feature vector. Feature vector is a matrix that contains the eigen vectors in descending order of their 
            eigen values. The eigen values here represent the amount of variance captured by that eigen vector(significance of the vector).The feature vectors are then used as input for the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            After performing PCA on the CIFAR-10 image dataset and training using the model available we could see that the time taken by 1 epoch of the model is drastically reduced (almost half) when compared
            to training with unaltered image dataset. Thus we can conclude that dimension reduction method can improve the training of a model significantly.

        <h2 class="text-center py-4 bg-green">Motion Deblurring</h2>
        <p class="py-4">
            Motion blur is the apparent streaking of moving objects in a photograph or a sequence of frames, such as a film or animation. It results when the image being recorded changes during the recording of a single exposure, due to rapid movement or long exposure.    
        </p>
        <p>
            Motion deblur is the process of the removing the streaking and the blur generated due to the motion of the object.
            The deblurring process requires a Point Spread Function which identifies the angle and the length of the motion of the blur.
            This PSF is then used for deblurring using different algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Calculating the Angle of Motion: <br>
            A motion blurred image contains a large number of lines that are created due to movement of objects. These lines can be detected using the Hough Transform.
            Hough transform is used to transform the image into a hough space where a point in the image space is represented in the hough space using rho and theta
            where rho is the distance of the point from the origin of the image and the theta is the angle made by the line that joins the point to the origin with the horizontal axis.
            All the points that lie on the same line will have the same coordinate in the hough space.
            For the detection of angle of motion an accumulator is used that accumulates the count of the points that have the same rho and theta value in the hough space. The theta value of that has the maximum value in the accumulator is the angle of the motion.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Calculating the Length of Motion: <br>
            Presence of an uniform blur in an image can result in uniform pattern in the frequency domain of the image. This behaviour can be used to detect the length of the motion blur.
            When the blurred image is transformed to frequency domain using fft a uniform pattern of black lines can be seen. The distance between the 2 consecutive black lines is the length of the blur.
            To calculate this the 2-D matrix is converted to 1-D matrix by taking the average of the elements of the columns of each row and plotting it with respect to the row number.
            The negative peaks in the graph represents the black lines in the fourier image and the distance between the two negative peak is taken as the difference of the x-axis values. 
            The distance is measured in pixels. This method is highly susceptible to noise and will need denoising before computation.
