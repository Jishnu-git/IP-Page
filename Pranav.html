        <p class="py-4">
            Feature detection includes methods for computing abstractions of image information and making local decisions at every image point whether there is an image feature of a given type at that point or not. The resulting features will be subsets of the image domain, often in the form of isolated points, continuous curves or connected regions.
            The terms corners and interest points are used somewhat interchangeably and refer to point-like features in an image, which have a local two dimensional structure.  Algorithms were then developed so that explicit edge detection was no longer required, for instance by looking for high levels of curvature in the image gradient.These points are frequently known as interest points, but the term "corner" is used by tradition.
            <br>
            Harris Corner Detector is a corner detection operator that is commonly used in computer vision algorithms to extract corners and infer features of an image.  Harris' corner detector takes the differential of the corner score into account with reference to direction directly, instead of using shifting patches for every 45 degree angles, and has been proved to be more accurate in distinguishing between edges and corners. Since then, it has been improved and adopted in many algorithms to preprocess images for subsequent applications.
            <br>
            <u>In this project, the Harris method will be implemented manually and compared with an inbuilt function of OpenCV. Improvements and scope for better efficiency will be explored.</u>
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-center py-4 bg-green">Completed Work</h2>
        <p class="py-4">
            The existing algorithm for the said method has been studied and undetstood. Corners of the resultant image are plotted with colored dots, which is done by scouting points in the image where there is a maximum change in intensity from its neighbours. Since HarrisCorner is an inbuilt function in OpenCV, user does not have much control over its parameters. For this project, entire Harris Corner was manually coded, following the algo step by step.
            <br>
            <br>
            Improvements made :
            <li>Applying a Gaussian Filter to reduce Noise</li>
            <li>Increasing Moving Window Size to 5x5 to re-iterate the corner points multiple times to minimize error.</li>
            <li>User control over parameters such as intensity threshold value and 'k' value of Matrix.</li>
            <li><u>Non-maximum suppresion algorithm implemented that prevents crowded corners by specifying a minimum plotting distance between any two corners. Distance threshold can be manually changed as per requirement.</u></li>

             Harris corner detector is a widely used tool in Image processing and known for its efficiency. However, lots of scope for improvements have been identified over the years. An improvement involves the use of an 'adaptive' threshold, which is calculated as the difference between max and min gray values of the image. It reduces feature space complexity and computational time. Also newer algorithms have been proposed to increase the precision of plotting corners, including machine learning models and CUDA-based programs. These will be further explored.
